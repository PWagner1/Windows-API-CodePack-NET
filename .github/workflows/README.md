# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the Windows API CodePack .NET project.

## Workflows Overview

### ðŸ”¨ `build.yml` - Build and Test
**Triggers:** Push to main/master/develop branches, Pull requests, Manual dispatch

This workflow:
- Builds the solution for multiple configurations (Debug/Release) and platforms (Any CPU, x64, x86)
- Supports all target frameworks (.NET Framework 4.6.2-4.8.1, .NET 8.0-9.0)
- Handles both managed C# projects and native C++ DirectX project
- Creates build artifacts for Release builds
- Generates NuGet packages on main/master branch builds
- Provides a placeholder for future test execution

**Matrix Strategy:**
- Configuration: Debug, Release
- Platform: Any CPU, x64, x86

### ðŸš€ `release.yml` - Release and Publish
**Triggers:** Release published, Manual dispatch

This workflow:
- Automatically builds and publishes NuGet packages when a GitHub release is created
- Supports manual version updates via workflow dispatch
- Publishes to both NuGet.org (if `NUGET_API_KEY` secret is configured) and GitHub Packages
- Uploads packages as GitHub release assets
- Automatically updates release notes with package information

**Manual Dispatch Options:**
- `version`: Specify version to release (e.g., "8.0.10")
- `publish_to_nuget`: Whether to publish to NuGet.org

### âœ… `pr-validation.yml` - PR Validation
**Triggers:** Pull request opened/updated

This workflow:
- Performs fast Debug build validation
- Validates project structure and required files
- Checks version consistency between configuration files
- Runs basic code quality checks
- Identifies large files that might need attention

## Setup Instructions

### Required Secrets

To enable full functionality, configure these repository secrets:

1. **`NUGET_API_KEY`** (Optional but recommended)
   - Your NuGet.org API key for publishing packages
   - Get from: https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
   - Scope: Push packages

2. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** (Automatic)
   - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
   - Used for GitHub Packages publishing and release management

### Setting up Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the secrets mentioned above

### Branch Protection (Recommended)

Consider setting up branch protection rules for `main`/`master`:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add a branch protection rule
3. Enable:
   - Require a pull request before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Select the "build" and "validate" checks

## Package Publishing

### Automatic Publishing (Recommended)

1. Create a new release on GitHub:
   - Go to Releases â†’ Create a new release
   - Create a new tag (e.g., `v8.0.10`)
   - Add release notes
   - Publish the release

2. The `release.yml` workflow will automatically:
   - Build the solution
   - Generate NuGet packages
   - Publish to configured package feeds
   - Update release notes

### Manual Publishing

You can also trigger releases manually:

1. Go to Actions â†’ Release and Publish
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Specify the version and publishing options
4. Run the workflow

## Supported Frameworks

The workflows support building for:

- **.NET Framework:** 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 4.8, 4.8.1
- **.NET:** 8.0-windows, 9.0-windows

## Generated Packages

The workflows generate these NuGet packages:

- `WindowsAPICodePackCore`
- `WindowsAPICodePackShell`
- `WindowsAPICodePackExtendedLinguisticServices`
- `WindowsAPICodePackSensors`
- `WindowsAPICodePackShellExtensions`

Each package includes both the main package (`.nupkg`) and symbol package (`.snupkg`).

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

1. Check the build logs in the Actions tab
2. Verify all required files are present in the repository
3. Ensure Directory.Build.props has correct version format

### Publishing Failures

1. Verify `NUGET_API_KEY` secret is correctly configured
2. Check if package versions already exist on NuGet.org
3. Ensure the API key has sufficient permissions

### DirectX Project Issues

The solution includes a native C++ DirectX project that requires:
- Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload
- Windows SDK
- The workflow uses MSBuild with appropriate platform configurations

## Adding Tests

To add test execution to the workflows:

1. Add test projects to your solution
2. Update the `test` job in `build.yml` to discover and run tests
3. Consider adding test result reporting and code coverage

Example test execution:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    dotnet test "Source/Current/Windows API CodePack/Windows API CodePack.sln" `
      --configuration Release `
      --no-build `
      --verbosity normal `
      --logger trx `
      --results-directory TestResults
```

## Workflow Status

You can monitor workflow status via:
- Repository Actions tab
- Status badges (add to main README.md)
- Email notifications (configure in GitHub settings)

## Contributing

When modifying workflows:
1. Test changes in a fork first
2. Use workflow dispatch for testing
3. Keep workflows focused and maintainable
4. Document any new requirements or secrets
